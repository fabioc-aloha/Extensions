# ACT Recommendations for Extensions

## Your Brain

Edition v1.0.0 is installed with the v1 brain (33 instructions, 16 skills, 20 prompts, 3 worker agents).

## First Steps

1. **Fill in your identity**: Edit `.github/copilot-instructions.local.md` with your project context, domain vocabulary, preferences, and constraints. This is heir-owned and survives Edition upgrades.
2. **Browse the Plugin Mall**: Run `/mall search <keyword>` to find plugins relevant to your project.
3. **Install a plugin**: Run `/mall install <name>` to add capabilities from the Mall.

## Recommended Plugins
