## What It Does

Workspace Watchdog records file activity in the background and provides commands for reviewing workspace health signals. Its broader stalled-work and TODO analysis is being expanded in the next modernization release.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Hot Files** | Files you open most often — your actual working set |
| **Stalled Files** | Files with uncommitted changes sitting >1d/3d/7d |
| **TODO Hotspots** | Files with the most TODO/FIXME comments |
| **Health Dashboard** | Green/Yellow/Red workspace health at a glance |
| **Passive scan** | Runs every 30 minutes in background, no manual action needed |
| **Right-click menus** | Right-click any folder in Explorer → **Show Dashboard** or **Scan Now** without opening the Palette |

## Stall Severity Tiers

| Tier | Threshold | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Warning | >1 day | Listed in dashboard |
| Alert | >3 days | Visible in sidebar |
| Critical | >7 days | Toast notification |

## Commands

| Command | Where | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `Workspace Watchdog: Show Dashboard` | Palette · Right-click folder | Open health dashboard in output panel |
| `Workspace Watchdog: Scan Now` | Palette · Right-click folder | Force immediate scan |
| `Workspace Watchdog: Hot Files` | Palette | QuickPick of most-opened files |
| `Workspace Watchdog: Stalled Files` | Palette | QuickPick of stalled files |
| `Workspace Watchdog: Clear History` | Palette | Reset all tracking data |

## Requirements

No external tools required. Works entirely within VS Code using the local file system. No cloud connection, no sign-in.

## Data Storage
