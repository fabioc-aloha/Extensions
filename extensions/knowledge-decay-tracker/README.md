## What It Does

Uses configurable decay profiles to surface documents that may need review. Scan a workspace, inspect the local report, and mark files as fresh after an intentional review.

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Forgetting Curve scoring** | Files decay on a configurable half-life schedule |
| **Four decay profiles** | Aggressive (14d), moderate (60d), slow (180d), permanent |
| **Status bar badge** | Overdue file count always visible in the status bar |
| **Staleness report** | Full workspace scan in the output channel |
| **Critical files quick pick** | Jump to worst offenders immediately |
| **Mark as fresh** | Reset the decay clock on reviewed files with one command |
| **Right-click menus** | Right-click any file in Explorer or Editor → **Mark as Fresh** or **Show Report** |

## Requirements

No external tools required. Optionally tag files with a decay profile by adding a comment at the top:

```
<!-- decay: moderate -->
```

| `aggressive` | 14 days | Rapidly changing docs |
